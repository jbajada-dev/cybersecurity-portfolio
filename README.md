# Cybersecurity Portfolio

I am enthusiastic about information security and enjoy finding solutions that can positively impact an organization and the people it serves. My background in software engineering, working across multiple organizations as a front-end and full-stack developer, has given me a deep understanding of the full software development lifecycle as well as agile practices. This has made me an affective communicator, working with tech leads, UX managers and CEOs to bring real solutions to company problems. I want to take the skills and mindset that I have learned and apply them to the field of cybersecurity, which I have a high degree of interest in. I aim to be at the forefront of protection from the ever evolving threats. With the advancements in AI technology I can only imagine what malicious threats may be looming arround the corner.
